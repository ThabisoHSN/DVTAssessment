Introduction: The DVTElevator Console Application is a C# simulation of how multiple lifts operate with the purpose of transferring passengers between several floors in real-time. This project covers important concepts of OOP principles, clean architecture and SOLID design patterns where code can be easily maintained and scaled. The application controls the movement of lifts inside a tall building, ensuring an ideal service for all passengers.
